# COBOL Multithreading Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a potential race condition in COBOL when dealing with multithreaded data transfer between areas.  The code shows how non-atomic operations can lead to unexpected behavior in concurrent environments. The solution proposes synchronization mechanisms to mitigate the race condition.

## Bug Description
The provided COBOL code snippet exhibits a race condition where the transfer of data from WS-AREA-1 to WS-AREA-2 is not atomic. In a multithreaded scenario, if one thread modifies WS-AREA-1 while another thread is reading WS-AREA-2, the second thread might encounter an inconsistent state, leading to unexpected behavior. 

## Solution
The solution involves synchronizing access to the shared data using appropriate synchronization mechanisms. This ensures that only one thread accesses and modifies the data at a time, preventing race conditions.  Further refinements may involve using COBOL's intrinsic functions for thread synchronization if available in the compiler.

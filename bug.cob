The above code snippet has a potential problem if WS-AREA-1 and WS-AREA-2 are used in a program that involves multiple threads. If thread A modifies WS-AREA-1 while thread B is accessing WS-AREA-2, it can lead to unexpected or incorrect results. This is because the data transfer from WS-AREA-1 to WS-AREA-2 is not atomic; it can be interrupted midway. Thus race conditions can lead to unpredictable outputs.
